Londontube Package Style
------------------------
We used the Sphinx documentation tools to demonstrate what functions do and what arguments they take, which is consistent throughout the package.

Additionally, there is also comments in the code to clarify and make it more readable.

Thirdly, the package also contains some metadata files (README.md, CITATION, LICENSE) to tell you briefly what the package does, how to cite it if you use it, and who can copy it.
